I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts, with quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down, I'm working on my ROAR
And thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
Free to do it all my way!

I think it's time that you and I
Arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about... aagh!
This child is getting wildly out of wing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm
Standing in the spotlight!
Not yet!

Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

Oh I just can't wait to be king!
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
